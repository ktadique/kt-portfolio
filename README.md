# Frontend Bootcamp Portfolio

## Description

[Kirsten T//Web Developer](https://ktadique.github.io/week-1-challenge/) is my portfolio website showcasing my skills as a frontend developer and was created as a part of the EDX Frontend Web Development Bootcamp.

My website contains 2 main sections - an 'About me' and a 'Projects/Work' section as well as methods to contact me at the bottom of the website, all accesible using the relevant links on the navigation bar.

I have also included a side social bar with some links to my relevant social media.
